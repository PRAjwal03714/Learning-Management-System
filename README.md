# Learning Management System Frontend(LMS)

## Overview </br>
Uses nextjs framework which uses react with some other added features for handling static and dynammic web page generation along with providing a very simple routing scheme.
Also uses tailwind for the css which nextjs will handle automatically when run. VS Code contains a built in LSP for tailwind that you can install if you're not familiar with
the formatting or all of the style classes

## How to use <br>
- make sure you have node installed and simply run npm run dev or npx run dev</br>
- got to localhost:3000
- currently doesn't have links to checkout seperate pages just enter the page in as the route to view it
- for any other parts of nextjs that are unfamiliar checkout the nextjs documentation. It has very solid explanations on all features
